- The architecture should have 4 different blocks with 1 output block.
- Each block should have only 3 convolution layer.
- One of the layers must be Depthwise Seperable Convolution
- One of the layers must use Dilated Convolution
- Complusory Global Average Pooling post that Fully Connected Layer should be added
- The total Receptive fields used must be more than 44
