# How to read this assignment work?

* `S5.ipynb` - This is the Notebook that you should run to experiment the model. The notebook has imported two helper scripts - `model.py` and `util.py`.
* `model.py` - The Neural Network architecture is defined in the `Net` class, inheriting the `torch.nn.Modules`. The `train` and `test` method is also defined inside the same python script
* `util.py` - This is the helper script, where most of the helper functions are defined and imported in the `S5.ipynb`



# Model Architecture
Experiment done on the MNIST Dataset

- Created a Neural Network to train the MNIST dataset
- The Model holds 4 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers
- The input images dimension is 28X28

Below is the architecture of the Neural Network
